# One Stop Fan Art Aggregator Website

## Overview:
There are so many excellent groups or games in the entertainment market nowadays. For example, Genshin Impact is a popular with all-platform players around the world. Because of that,  fans are willing to spend time viewing fan creations or watch videos related to the game or group. However, because so many platforms are due to worldwide fan groups, it is hard to view all content at one time. By developing an aggregator website for a specific fan group, users can share and view content only related to the group or game instead of switching between pages. 


There are four main functions of the website:<br />
  * Visitors can see the history and some knowledge related to the topic.<br />
  * Users can see the newest content.<br />
  * Creators can upload their artwork.<br />
  * Viewers can watch random videos if they are tired of the recommendation system. <br />
